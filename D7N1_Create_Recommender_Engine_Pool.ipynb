    "1. Using playlist names as genre tags heavily rely on *user opinion* and not *extracted music features* (compare this from the methods used in the [GTZAN genre collection dataset](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-music-genre-classification/)\n",
    "2. Playlists with dual genre names exists, and appear quite often in the dataset (e.g. Electronic Pop, Classical Rock)\n",
    "3. Although a dominant genre could be readily observed, recent music tend to incorporate many genres at a time and thus create less distinction when the model looks at the audio features.\n",

    "## Model Improvement\n",
    "To enhance the model accuracy, try to do the following:\n",
    "1. Pick \"purer\" top-followed playlists for the training data. A quick way to do this is to pick playlists that contain pre 2000's music as majority as these are less hybridized than more recent songs.\n",
    "2. Try fewer but broader genres as categories (4-5 genres)\n",
    "3. Remove outlier songs! These are the songs that dont fit its playlist's description. A bit subjective (and tedious!).\n",
    "4. Limit the features used as predictors (could be inferred from the list of genres you're considering)\n"
